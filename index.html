                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>My name is Chris Norman, and I am an aspiring software developer living in the south-east UK. I have a passion for technology and a desire to learn and to grow my programming skillset. My background in physics provides me with strong analytical skills and a creative, yet logical approach to problem-solving, enabling me to overcome any challenges I am faced with. I possess solid teamwork and communication skills picked up throughout my degree and during my extensive customer service experience, enabling me to work efficiently with colleagues and clients alike. I am extremely excited to begin my career in software and to continue to improve my technical skills alongside an organisation that will help guide me and facilitate my growth as a developer.
